# Adaptable Dimension Embeddings

## 🎯 Purpose & Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, but their embedding dimensions are often fixed at high values (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI embeddings), leading to unnecessary computational costs and storage requirements. This example demonstrates how to implement adaptable dimension embeddings that dynamically optimize the embedding dimension based on task requirements, significantly reducing costs while maintaining performance.

**Business Value:**
- Reduce embedding storage costs
- Decrease inference latency
- Maintain task performance with smaller embedding dimensions
- Enable cost-effective scaling of LLM applications

## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

- Start with a conservative dimension reduction (e.g., 80%) and gradually optimize
- Use task-specific evaluation metrics to validate performance
- Consider the trade-off between compression ratio and performance
- Implement A/B testing to validate improvements in production
